### Predictability and Control

* Using onChanges you can easily decide how changes in your bindings with change the internal state of you component
* You can react to changes on your bindings as one thing, instead of a bunch of watches. Readability on templates and more options on the controller.
* With '&' bindings the parent controller has control of how it will react to child events, and it's API will be more concise.
